What does the group do when two or more members disagree (ex. On a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?

Make sure everyone’s voice is heard> Listen to both points of view. If it can’t be resolved between two people, get the group involved and then potentially an outside resource.



What does this group do when a member is frustrated?

Listen to why the member is frustrated, try to problem solve and help. Remember that someone else might be able to help. Take a walk!

Remember to put yourself in the other person’s shoes. Ask what’s going on and talk to them. Empathy first: there’s always going to be a reason why someone is struggling. Assume good intentions.



What does this group do when we merge our work together?

Make sure everything is assigned properly. Go through merge work together. Make sure we don’t introduce bugs, see where everyone is. 



When does this group ask for help?

Make sure to google first. Go for a walk? Then go to your team by putting questions in slack channel so people can check in when they have time to help. Be more vocal if you’re stuck for too long and no one responds via slack.



How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?

We expect pair programming to be fluid as we work on the project, and we will keep checking in with each other to see what works best.



How does this group approach work “after hours” (i.e., after normal class hours and weekends)?

Check in at the end of each day and see what else needs to be done to stay on track. Assign remote work as needed for individual assignments, but don’t merge until we’re together the next morning. Take advantage of slack to work remotely, discuss weekend work in advance. Let team know in advance of any scheduling conflicts if you can’t do evening/weekend work.



What time does this group have daily stand up?

First thing in the morning (11 am).
